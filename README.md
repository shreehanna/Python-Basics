# 🐍 Python-Basics

Beginner-level Python projects while I level up my skills from zero to Big Tech 🚀  
These cover core concepts like:

- ✅ Conditionals  
- 🔁 Loops  
- 🧠 Functions  
- 📦 File Handling  
- 🔄 OOP (coming soon 👀)

Built as part of my journey to master Python and smash internships at places like Apple 🍏.  
Stick around — this repo’s only getting better.
